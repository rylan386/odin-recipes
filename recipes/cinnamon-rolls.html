                <p>One of my favorite treats to snack on are cinnamon rolls. The texture and flavor go really well together,

                        <li>3/4 brown suguar</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Frosting ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup softened cream cheese</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm milk. In another bowl, combine sugar, butter, eggs, salt, yeast mixture and 2 cups flour; 
                            beat on medium speed until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).</li>
                        <li>Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, 
                            turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
                        <li>Mix brown sugar and cinnamon. Punch down dough; divide in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 portion into an 11x8-in. 
                            rectangle. Brush with 2 tablespoons butter; sprinkle with half the brown sugar mixture to within 1/2 in. of edges. 
                            Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 8 slices; place in a greased 13x9-in. pan, cut side down. 
                            Cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350°.</li>
                        <li>Bake until golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Cool on wire racks.</li>
                        <li>For frosting, beat butter, cream cheese, vanilla and salt until blended; gradually beat in confectioners’ sugar. Spread over tops. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
                    </ol>
